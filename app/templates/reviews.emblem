			blockquote I decided that I needed to see someone about changing my body shape and just a general refresher about what I wanted to achieve out of my gym work. Jarrod gave me the motivation and encouragement to push myself a little harder to achieve the desired results. I found his exercises to be really exciting and fun and easy to do both at the gym and at home rather than restricting myself to one place. He has a 'can-do' attitude that helps you push yourself to achieve any exercise he gives you.

			blockquote  I am so glad I started my program with Jarrod, I couldn't ask for a better fit. He's tough; however he gives me that little extra push I need that without I wouldn't achieve. Jarrod understands about the days when you just can't muster up the strength that you had on good days, but also helps me jump into the workout with a positive attitude and I really look forward to the days that I train.
